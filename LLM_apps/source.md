### Robinhood Strategies
Robinhood Strategies is a cutting edge wealth management service that gives you expert financial advice and the knowledge to effectively plan for your future. Robinhood Strategies includes financial advice for everyone, offering:  

A low .25% annual management fee for all customers with a yearly cap of only $250 for Robinhood Gold members. That means free management for Gold members on every dollar over $100k and an effective management fee of 0.1% for portfolios with $250k or 0.05% for those with $500k. 
Access to a diversified mix of both single stocks and ETFs based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and other factors we learn. The portfolios are actively managed to provide access to more opportunities.
An interactive portfolio that shows performance over time and overall asset allocation, while letting you drill down into individual holdings, top drivers to your returns, and easily set up recurring investments. 
Timely market and portfolio insights, delivered in-app in writing and via audio recording, to give you the full context behind major market moves and portfolio adjustments. 
Simulated future returns using Monte Carlo simulations–all right in the app.
More control, with the freedom to restrict a select number of stocks to help keep your portfolio aligned with your preferences.  
Tax advantages, by aiming to select tax lots to sell to minimize taxable gains, thoughtfully incorporating external assets transferred in, and incorporating turnover limits for taxable accounts. 
Help managing gains and losses. As the year ends, we’ll total your gains and losses so you can choose to harvest any losses.
Managed individual and retirement accounts with support for joint accounts coming soon.

### Robinhood Cortex
This is just the beginning of how we’ll use artificial intelligence to help power your investing experience at Robinhood. At launch, Robinhood Cortex is designed to up-level your trading and investing experience supporting: 

Stock Digests: This helps you answer the age-old question of, “Why is this stock going up or down today?” With Robinhood Cortex, simply go to the stock detail page, and we will quickly generate a short summary of what’s happening in the world to impact that ticker.   
Trade Builder: It’s a tool designed to simplify the trading process and help you learn about new strategies that align with your goals. For example, it makes the options trading experience more intuitive by helping you translate your beliefs about a stock into a specific options trade and strategy. We’ll use Robinhood Cortex to show you insights about price signals, technicals, market news, analyst reports, and more, and then Trade Builder will screen the market for trades to consider based on your inputs.
